 Beginner JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript projects I've built as a beginner to practice and improve my coding skills.

 ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside

Each project is simple and focused on learning the core concepts of JavaScript, including:
- Variables and data types
- Functions
- Loops and conditionals
- DOM manipulation
- Events and user interaction

 ðŸš€ Projects So Far
- Console-based scripts (e.g., print messages, handle arguments)
- Basic loops and conditionals
- Mini calculators
- Simple web interactivity

More coming soon as I keep learning!

 ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:
- Practice writing clean JavaScript code
- Build consistency and coding discipline
- Document my learning journey publicly
